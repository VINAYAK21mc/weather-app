This is one of my first projects built by watching the tutorial for next js 14. It's a weather app that teaches one how to consume apis use in next js using important features of nextjs like ssr, caching.This app also covers the usage of context api and react hooks and shadcn for ui components.
I have thought of some other features like authentication and user account management etc that can be added in this project.
Lets see how it goesüëç
ps: the project was actually built by thecodedealer I just followed the tutorial and made sure to learn from it.
